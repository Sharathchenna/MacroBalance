# MacroTracker RevenueCat Hard Paywall Implementation

## Overview

MacroTracker implements a hard paywall approach using RevenueCat. A hard paywall blocks access to the entire app until a subscription is purchased. This is different from a soft paywall, which would allow partial access to app features.

## Implementation Details

### PaywallGate Component

The implementation uses a `PaywallGate` component that wraps all routes in the app. This gate checks if the user has a valid subscription before allowing access to any screen.

Key features:
- Blocks all app functionality until a subscription is purchased
- No trial or free tier access
- Clear subscription options with RevenueCat's PaywallView
- Proper subscription status management

### RevenueCat Integration

RevenueCat is used for:
1. In-app purchase management
2. Subscription validation
3. Cross-platform subscription handling
4. Paywall presentation

## Code Structure

### Key Components

1. **PaywallGate**: Wraps all routes and checks subscription status
2. **PaywallScreen**: Handles displaying the RevenueCat paywall UI
3. **SubscriptionProvider**: Manages subscription state throughout the app

### Configuration

The RevenueCat SDK is initialized in `main.dart` with the appropriate API keys for each platform.

## App Store Submission Guidelines

When submitting an app with a hard paywall, ensure:

1. The full billed amount is clearly shown
2. Introductory offer details (if any) are clearly disclosed
3. Opportunity to cancel is clearly stated
4. Terms & conditions and privacy policy are accessible
5. No misleading marketing text

## Testing

To test the paywall:
1. Use RevenueCat sandbox mode for iOS
2. Use Google Play testing tracks for Android
3. Verify all subscription states are handled correctly

## Development Notes

- The `allowDismissal: false` parameter ensures users cannot dismiss the paywall without subscribing
- Subscription status is refreshed after any interaction with the paywall
- A snackbar message informs users that subscription is required if they attempt to dismiss the paywall
