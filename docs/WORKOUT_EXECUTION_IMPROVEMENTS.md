### New Features Added

#### Set Completion Tracking
```dart
void _trackCompletedSet() {
  final completedSet = _currentSet.copyWith(isCompleted: true);
  _completedSets[_currentExerciseIndex]?.add(completedSet);
  
  // Calculate volume
  if (completedSet.weight != null && completedSet.reps != null) {
    final setVolume = completedSet.weight! * completedSet.reps!;
    setState(() {
      _totalVolume += setVolume;
    });
  }
  
  _updateWorkoutProgress();
}
```

#### Real-time Progress Updates
```dart
Future<void> _updateWorkoutProgress() async {
  final updatedExercises = <WorkoutExercise>[];
  
  for (int i = 0; i < widget.routine.exercises.length; i++) {
    final completedSetsForExercise = _completedSets[i] ?? [];
    if (completedSetsForExercise.isNotEmpty) {
      updatedExercises.add(originalExercise.copyWith(
        sets: completedSetsForExercise,
      ));
    }
  }

  final updatedLog = _currentWorkoutLog!.copyWith(
    completedExercises: updatedExercises,
    totalVolume: _totalVolume,
  );

  await workoutProvider.updateCurrentWorkout(updatedLog);
}
```

#### Motivational Progress Messages
```dart
String _getMotivationalMessage() {
  final completionPercentage = (completedSets / totalSets) * 100;
  
  if (completionPercentage >= 75) return 'Almost there! ðŸ’ª';
  else if (completionPercentage >= 50) return 'Great progress! ðŸ”¥';
  else if (completionPercentage >= 25) return 'Keep it up! ðŸ’¯';
  else return 'Strong start! ðŸš€';
}
```
