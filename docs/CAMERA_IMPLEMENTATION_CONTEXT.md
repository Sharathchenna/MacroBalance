- **Theme System**: Centralized design tokens and styling

#### Data Flow
```
CameraScreen -> CameraService -> Hardware
     â†“              â†“
BarcodeService -> MLKit Detection
     â†“
Stream Results -> UI Updates
```

## Key Dependencies

### Camera & Media

- `image_picker: ^1.0.4` - Gallery integration
- `permission_handler: ^11.0.1` - Runtime permissions

### Computer Vision
- `google_mlkit_barcode_scanning: ^0.7.0` - Barcode detection
- `google_mlkit_commons: ^0.6.0` - MLKit common utilities

### UI & Interaction
- Flutter's built-in haptic feedback
- Custom glassmorphism implementations
- Animation controllers for smooth transitions

## Design Philosophy

### Premium User Experience
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear mode indicators and instruction text

- **Performance**: Optimized for real-time camera operations

### Cross-Platform Consistency
- **Native Performance**: Platform-specific optimizations where needed
- **Unified Interface**: Consistent behavior across iOS and Android
- **Feature Parity**: All Swift features replicated in Flutter

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Mode Switching**: Test transitions between all three camera modes
2. **Barcode Detection**: Test with various barcode formats and lighting conditions
3. **Permission Flow**: Test camera permission denial and recovery
4. **Lifecycle Events**: Test app backgrounding/foregrounding during camera use
5. **Error Handling**: Test camera unavailable scenarios
